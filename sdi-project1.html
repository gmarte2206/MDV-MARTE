<p>TESTING CHANGE. I am choosing to use my personal training and teaching schedule as my theme. I am a Muay Thai instructor and a Brazilian Jiu Jitsu practitioner. A typical day for me includes up to two Brazilian Jiu Jitsu (BJJ) training sessions and at least one Muay Thai class that I teach. My BJJ class may consist of either drilling sessions or conditioning sessions. The Muay Thai classes I teach consist of either bagging or sparring. If my morning BJJ class is a conditioning class and my Muay Thai class a sparring class then I wont take the second BJJ class. If my morning class is a drilling class then regardless of what my Muay Thai class is I will take the second BJJ class.

   </p>
<p>While my schedule is quite hectic as it includes multiple classes that I teach throughout the day along with private clients and my own training regimen, I am going to keep it simple and concise as to not make my code too convoluted with different schedules since my schedule is never set in stone.</p>
